/*
  This file contains only custom CSS rules that are not easily
  achievable with direct Tailwind CSS utility classes, or for
  organizational preferences.

  Most styling for this project is now handled directly via
  Tailwind classes in the HTML.
*/

/* --- Font Family --- */
/* It's good practice to declare the primary font here if you're using Google Fonts or custom fonts. */
/* Tailwind's default font stack is good, but if 'Inter' is crucial, declare it. */
body {
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}

/* --- Base Layout Overrides (if necessary, but mostly handled by Tailwind in HTML) --- */
/*
  The following were previously in your custom CSS but are now largely
  handled by Tailwind classes in index.html:

  .container
  .section-title
  .detail-item
  .detail-label
  .detail-value
  .button-group
  .action-button (including make-call-button, sos-button, etc.)
  .modal
  .modal-content
  .close-button

  Unless you have very specific, complex custom styling for these elements
  that cannot be expressed efficiently with Tailwind utility classes,
  you do not need to re-add them here.
*/

/*
  Example: If you wanted a unique shadow or animation not covered by Tailwind's defaults,
  you would define it here:
*/
/*
.custom-shadow-effect {
    box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
*/

/*
  Example: If you had a custom component structure that was very repetitive
  with Tailwind classes, you might create a reusable class here using @apply (with PostCSS/Tailwind CLI):
*/
/*
.my-custom-card {
    @apply bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-4;
}
